5c43ad7 & 27 Feb 2019 & Halil Pasic & { ccw: be more precise about the semantic of revision 1


Revision 1 of the CCW transport is currently defined as virtio 1.0. This
could become confusing when we bump the version of the virtio
specification to 1.1, in a sense that it could be interpreted like one
can not use any features not part of the 1.0 specification.

So let us try to avoid confusion regarding the semantic of virtio-ccw
revision 1.

d348ac0 & 27 Feb 2019 & Halil Pasic & { introduction: simplify the designation of legacy


The sentence designating the documents defining what later
became known as the legacy virtio interface had the most
important piece of information placed in parenthesis.

Let's reword this sentence so we avoid using an ambiguous designation
based on a relative anchor (i.e. 'earlier drafts of this specification')
and just use the absolute anchor (version 1.0).

bef3ff7 & 07 Mar 2019 & Stefan Hajnoczi & { virtio-blk: document data[] size constraints


The struct virtio_blk_req->data[] field is a multiple of 512 bytes long
for read and write requests.  Flush requests don't use data[] at all.

The new discard and write zeroes requests being introduced in VIRTIO 1.1
put struct virtio_blk_discard_write_zeroes elements into data[], so it
must be a multiple of the struct size.

The uint8_t data[][512] pseudo-code makes it look like discard and write
zeroes requests must pad to 512 bytes.  This wastes memory since struct
virtio_blk_discard_write_data is only 16 bytes long.

Furthermore, all known implementations wishing to take advantage of this
upcoming VIRTIO 1.1 feature do not use 512-byte padding (Linux
virtio_blk.ko, QEMU virtio-blk device emulation, the SPDK virtio-blk
driver, and the SPDK vhost-user-blk device backend).

This patch documents the data[] size constraints clearly in the driver
normative section.  This is clearer than the current pseudo-code.

The text describing the legacy interface also obliquely refers to a
non-transitional implementation. This seems to cause confusion
and there's no good reason to do it here: this section
is about legacy interface and transitional devices,
it add not value at all. Just drop it.

Note: the spec does not make it clear whether description of the legacy
interface is normative or not, and in particular, this section is not
linked to from any conformance targets.
Resolving that is left for later.

Duplicated text "errors, data_len, sense_len and residual MUST reside in
a single, separate device-writable descriptor" appears +both in the
beginning and at the end of the 2nd sentence.

The original text:

For SCSI commands there are additional constraints. errors, data_len,
sense_len and residual MUST reside in a single, separate device-writable
descriptor, sense MUST reside in a single separate device-writable
descriptor of size 96 bytes, and errors, data_len, sense_len and
residual MUST reside a single separate device-writable descriptor.
I suggest to delete the 1st one, so in the end result, fields are
described in same order as appear in struct virtio_scsi_pc_req.

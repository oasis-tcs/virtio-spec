Decision:

In Section 2.4.5, "The Virtqueue Available Ring", it says:

> If the VIRTIO_RING_F_INDIRECT_DESC feature bit is not negotiated, the
> “flags” field offers a crude interrupt

Shouldn't it be VIRTIO_RING_F_EVENT_IDX instead of
VIRTIO_RING_F_INDIRECT_DESC?
The next paragraph says:

> Otherwise, if the VIRTIO_RING_F_EVENT_IDX feature bit is negotiated, the
> driver MUST set the "flags" field

The same question also applies to Section 2.4.6.

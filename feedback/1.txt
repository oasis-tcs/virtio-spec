- The first three chapters sometimes uses the pronoun "we" in sentences.
  I think this should be avoided, since it is not always clear who is
  meant with this pronoun: The reader? The driver? The device?

- Some of the generic sections still use the term "PCI" though they
  should not.

I tried to mention the related spots below, but I'd like to suggest to
scan again the whole document for "we" and "PCI" to be sure to get
everything right.

Page 8 / Introduction:

- "Extensible: Virtio PCI devices contain feature bits ..."
  => Remove the "PCI" in above sentence.

Page 10 / Configuration Space:

- "... nor or reads from multiple fields"
  => that's difficult to parse, is this sentence right?

Page 14 / The Virtqueue Available Ring

- "The available ring refers to what descriptor chains the driver is
  offering the device"
  => Somewhat hard to read, maybe better something like this:
  "The available ring refers to the descriptor chains that the driver
  is offering to the device" ?

- "The "idx" field indicates where we would put the next descriptor
  entry in the ring"
  => "The "idx" field indicates where the driver would put the next
  descriptor entry in the ring"

Page 16 / Device Initialization:

- "2. Set the ACKNOWLEDGE status bit: we have noticed the device."
  => "2. The guest OS sets the ACKNOWLEDGE status bit to indicate
  that it has noticed the device."

- "3. Set the DRIVER status bit: we know how to drive the device."
  => "3. The driver sets the DRIVER status bit to indicate that
  it knows how to drive the device"

Page 18 / Notifying the device:

- "... we go ahead and write to the PCI configuration space."
  => "... the driver can go ahead and write to the configuration space."

- "The avail_event field wraps naturally at 65536 as well, iving the
  following algorithm ..."
  => What does "iving" mean? I did not find that in my dictionary.

Page 19:

- "It can then process used ring entries finally enabling interrupts ..."
  => This sentence is hard to parse ... is there missing something
  before "finally"?
